    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet and spiced, this strudel is a winner. Be sure to melt the butter used to separate the layers of pastry, as this makes for a great flaky crust.    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750g/1lb 10oz Bramley apples, peeled, cored, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>1½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ unwaxed lemon, zest only</li>
        <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>75g/2½oz raisins</li>
        <li>95g/3½oz butter</li>
        <li>40g/1½oz white breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>6 large sheets filo pastry</li>
        <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Line a baking tray with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Mix the apples with the cinnamon, lemon zest and juice, sugar and raisins. In a small frying pan, melt 20g/¾oz butter and fry the breadcrumbs until golden-brown, then add to the apple mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining butter in a pan. On a clean, dry tea-towel lay a sheet of the filo and brush with some of the melted butter. Lay another sheet on top and repeat until you have used all of the filo.</li>
        <li>Pile the filling along the length of the pastry along one side about 2-3cm/1in from the edge and using the tea-towel to help you, roll the pastry up to enclose the filling. Tuck the ends in and roll seam-side down onto the lined baking sheet. Brush with the remaining melted butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, until golden-brown. Leave to cool to room temperature and dust with icing sugar. Slice and serve with cream, ice cream or custard.</li>
    </ol>
