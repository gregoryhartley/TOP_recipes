    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>8 thin slices bread</li>
        <li> 50g/2oz sultanas</li>
        <li>2 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
        <li> 350ml/12fl oz full-fat milk</li>
        <li>50ml/2fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
        <li>25g/1oz granulated sugar</li>
        <li>nutmeg, grated, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 1 litre/2 pint pie dish with butter. Cut the crusts off the bread. Spread each slice with on one side with butter, then cut into triangles.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of bread, buttered-side up, in the bottom of the dish, then add a layer of sultanas. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then repeat the layers of bread and sultanas, sprinkling with cinnamon, until you have used up all of the bread. Finish with a layer of bread, then set aside.</li>
        <li>Gently warm the milk and cream in a saucepan over a low heat to scalding point. Do not let it boil. Crack the eggs into a bowl, add three-quarters of the sugar and lightly whisk until pale. Add the warm milk and cream mixture and stir well, then strain the custard into a bowl. Pour the custard over the prepared bread layers, sprinkle with nutmeg and the remaining sugar and leave to stand for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Place the dish into the oven and bake for 30â€“40 minutes, or until the custard has set and the top is golden brown.</li>
